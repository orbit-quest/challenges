# Challenges

We can start with 2 types of content (challenges and portfolio projects).

## Challenges

An interesting exercise where there is one only valid anwser.

### Examples

- Given this dataset, what are the coordinate of the hottest area?
- Given this dataset, how many people under 30 years old lived in California in 2023?

The goal is to practice a specific skill or technology.
For the first example that would be to find the maximum value in a dataset, either visually or through code.
For the second one it would be to filter a dataset by multiple criteria.

## Portfolio projects

A potentially longer exercise where there are no unique answer. Ideally it has a visual component.

### Examples

- Given these datasets, create a map of the train transportation system of Japan.

The goal is to give users a realistic project that they can use on their portfolio to help them find jobs.
